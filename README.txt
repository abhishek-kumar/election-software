This is a LAMP / WAMP based software written in PHP
that facilitates the conduct of elections within an
organization.

This software was used to conduct the elections for the
Council of Student Affairs (CSA) at BITS Pilani from 
2007 to 2009.

Salient features:
 * s/w supports multiple posts with multiple candidates for each post
 * s/w supports partitioning the voters into groups where each group
   can vote for particular set of posts (e.g. hostel representatives
   vs campus wide representatives vs department representatives)
 * The architecture features n servers with 1 additional backup server
   which is updated by each of the n servers periodically.
